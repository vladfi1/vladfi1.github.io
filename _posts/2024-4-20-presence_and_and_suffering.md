title: Downsides (and Upsides) of Mindful Presence

## Part 1: Difficulties with Presence

One of the first things you hear from meditation teachers is how wonderful "presence" is. Mindfulness, the present moment, etc. are all spoken about in glowing terms. But the question arises: if presence were so wonderful, why aren't we doing it already?

The reason I see is that presence actually can increase suffering. We lose ourselves in thought in order to avoid things like anxiety, discomfort, and boredom that we would otherwise feel. I think this is particularly true for the type of people who find meditation and go on retreats; typically these are people who are in some way suffering from poor mental health and are looking for something that might help them. People whose minds naturally tend towards positive states probably aren't seeking help!

When you start trying to be present, you are confronted with all these unpleasant things, and it is very understandable that your mind resists and tries to find distraction again. I have had so many meditation sits where "active mindfulness" (e.g. trying to follow the breath) led to tension and struggle, while idle fantasizing or mind wandering led to ease, relaxation, and a sense of well-being. No wonder the mind is inclined to the latter rather than the former!

Meanwhile, you are being told that presence should be wonderful and it is semi-implied to be the cure to all your problems, so you start blaming yourself for not doing presence right, which doesn't help at all and can significantly increase suffering. This was my experience with meditation for many years. I am slowly getting out of this trap by seeing the dynamic more clearly, which allows me to understand and forgive myself for struggling with presence. I do wish I'd been warned about it from the beginning though; it wasn't until a recent retreat with Leela Sarti that I heard these ideas from a teacher. In general I wish meditation teaching focused a lot more on the psychology that goes along with meditation practice.

## Part 2: Presence can be Good

I have also, after great deals of struggling and suffering, experienced the "good" type of presence, and I can say that it is in fact wonderful although different from how I expected it. All of the "bad stuff" -- fear, discomfort, uncertainty, etc. -- is actually still there. What's different is that there is a lot more patience, a willingness to be with the bad feelings and see where they go. In my normal state, a bad feeling almost instantly results in an unhelpful counter-reaction resisting it or attempting to do something about it. In a state of presence, my mind reacts much less quickly, and I instead find myself waiting to see what arises after the bad feeling. Usually, after around 10 or so seconds (an eternity to my impatient mind) something shifts; the bad feeling fades away, or transforms into something more pleasant, or I have an insight into what is behind the feeling. This shift seems to happen spontaneously, without me willfully trying to make something happen.

Other properties I've noticed about presence include a sort of spontenaity, where I don't need to have my future planned out and am ok with uncertainty about what will happen. This allows me to change course based on whatever impulses arise in the moment; maybe I get curious about something on the side of the road and spend the next ten minutes staring at a beetle as it does something funny; maybe that means I no longer have time to walk the whole loop before lunch as I had planned and but that's ok.

Needless to say, living this way all the time would be incredible. I think this is one of the aims of meditation practice, and perhaps very experienced or fortunate practictioners do experience life in this way most of the time.

However, as with other very positive experiences, simply having had this experience has unfortunately not led to me being able to reproduce it. I've certainly tried, but trying seems to just result in me "acting out" what I think the good state would be like, "pretending" to be patient or understanding or compassionate. This has never worked and mostly just results in frustration. My guess is that this doesn't work because the "good state" is characterized by "not willfully making things happen", which is directly at odds with "try to get into the good state".

The question then becomes: how can we find these good states? Unfortunately I don't have an answer. For me, they seem to come after periods of significant suffering, often at the tail end of week(s)-long silent retreats. I suspect that some sort of reinforcement learning is happening in my brain, where after enough occurrences of unhelpful mental moves (self-criticism, anger, needing things to be a certain way, etc.) leading to pain, my mind finally catches on and starts to ease up, allowing opposite qualities to arise: patience, love, curiosity, etc. I really wish these hard-earned lesson would stick for longer, but at least for me the "bad" tendencies seem to be pretty ingrained.
